Known Issues
============

.. _introspecting-percent-columns:

Introspecting tables with '%' columns
-------------------------------------

Attempting to run ``manage.py inspectdb`` with ``DEBUG = True`` will raise 
``TypeError: not enough arguments for format string``. This is due to ``CursorDebugWrapper``
and its use of % format strings. If you encounter this problem, you can either rename
the database column so it does not include a '%' (percent) character, or change ``DEBUG = False`` 
in your settings when you run ``manage.py inspectdb``.

.. _azure-clustered-indices:

Azure requires clustered indices
--------------------------------

From http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee336245.aspx#cir

	Windows Azure SQL Database does not support tables without clustered indexes. 
	A table must have a clustered index. If a table is created without a clustered
	constraint, a clustered index must be created before an insert operation is 
	allowed on the table.

The workaround is to dump the create SQL, add a clustered index, manually apply 
the SQL to the database.
