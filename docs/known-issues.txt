Introspecting tables with '%' columns
-------------------------------------

Attempting to run ``manage.py inspectdb`` with ``DEBUG = True`` will raise 
``TypeError: not enough arguments for format string``. This is due to ``CursorDebugWrapper``
and its use of % format strings. If you encounter this problem, you can either rename
the database column so it does not include a '%' (percent) character, or ``DEBUG = False`` 
when you run ``manage.py inspectdb``.
